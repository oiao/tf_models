## Generative Adversarial Network Barebones

### Usage (see `aux.py`):
Generate a GAN that ideally draws points from a gaussian mixture as defined by _X_.
The resulting generator works in a latent dimension of 10.
``` python
from tf_models.gan import GAN, scatter, gaussian_mixture
# dimX == 2, dimZ == 10
X     = gaussian_mixture(n=10000,dim=2,ngaussians=4,seed=40)
gan   = GAN(latent_dim=10, layers=(3,3), neurons=(16,16))
```

Check the model before the training. The contour plot shows the
distribution of our training data _X_ while red points are
generated by the GAN:
``` python
# Generate 3000 new points prior to training:
gan.set_models(2) # this is called automatically when gan.train() is called, but we set it before training to demonstrate the generator before training
Z     = gan.latent_sample(3000)
Xpred = gan.G.predict(Z)
scatter(X,Xpred)
```

Now train the model:
``` python
gan.train(X, epochs=500)
```

And generate new points again:
``` python
# Generate 3000 new points after training:
Z     = gan.latent_sample(3000)
Xpred = gan.G.predict(Z)
scatter(X,Xpred)
```
